# Secrets

_Secrets_ is an application where you can anonymously share your deepest, 
darkest secrets with the entire internet and have people comment on them.

The best part of this totally viable application is: you have to build it!

 your terminal or using your Postgres GUI program (like Postico).
 
2. Check out the hosted finished version of this application here:
